# ABCMusicGen

ABCMusicGen is a program which procedural generates music based on provided input data using a random forest. The process begins with a program called Maestro which converts midi songs into an ASCII format known as ABC notation. This is done for four instruments: drums, bass, lute and clarinet. An entire song is represented within one line of data and the following is done to the convert ABC notation into a meaningful data set for ML algorithms. The initial values for a line of data are the tempo, followed by a one-hot representation of the timing, key, and personally assigned setting, mood, and environment. The ASCII document is then searched and a dictionary created for each unique note found. Every note is then represented as a one-hot value corresponding to the dictionary key and the data set of one-hot notes is iteratively built beginning with the drums, followed by the bass, followed by the lute, followed by the clarinet. With this dataset a song can now be built. Using a seed of tempo, timing, key, setting, mood, and environment followed by three notes in one-hot format. the master data set is refined to the first three notes and trained by a random forest. Using the  The master data set is then refined to the length of the seed and a random forest classifies the 4th note. This note is then added to the data set and
